Creative AI is an emerging field in artificial intelligence that focuses on generating art, music, stories, and other creative works using machine learning models.

Unlike traditional AI applications in healthcare, finance, or marketing, this course dives into AI's ability to express creativity—raising questions like:
Can AI truly be creative?
Can AI generate art that rivals human imagination?

# What is Deep Dream?
Deep Dream is an AI algorithm developed by Google’s Alex Mordvintsev, designed to visualize what a neural network sees inside its hidden layers.

How it works:
When a neural network processes an image, its early layers detect simple features like edges and shapes.

Deeper layers combine these features to recognize more complex objects (faces, animals).

Deep Dream amplifies the patterns detected by these layers, leading to dream-like, surreal images.

just like cloud-gazing: you see a horse or a face in the clouds based on what your brain has seen before.
Deep Dream does the same, it imagines based on its training.

Result:
Trippy, colorful, distorted images—often filled with animal eyes, faces, or buildings where they don’t belong.
It gives us insight into how neural networks "understand" the world.
